# Business Funding Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to predict which business funding applicants would have the best chance of success in their ventures.  The best course of action could be to create a neural network machine learning model to predict success based on other application variables.  These other specific variables included application type, classification, ask amount (how much funding the applicant requests), and applicant income.

Three attempts were made to accurately fit the model by manipulating the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer and activation functions.  Each attempt slightly improved fit accuracy, but neither model was more than 72% accurate (not sufficient).

For future models, decreasing the number of feature variables or manipulating epochs or binning stratification could have a more positive affect on model accuracy.
